** TODO for HASCS **

  1. check for meaning of deleted INTEGER -- does it need to be changed 
     to (int) cast to get negative values right?
  2. check all switch() for break
  3. Bool values for A IN B => !!(A & B)
  4. (done) undo changed INC()/DEC() order in dialog.c hascsedi.c 
     hascsspi.c
  5. check for missing {} around single-line bodies
  6. (done) 0C => '\0'
  7. replace ~ü~ü and other charset  specific stuff (umlauts)
     by correct \u...
  8. search for sizeof, usually near direct read into memory
  9. check for BITSET variables with arithmetic operators, change them 
     to C bitwise operators
 10. some funcs really rely on HIGH(...)
 11. sometimes the original source code usees  BeginOutput instead of 
     BeginOutput(). Does Modula execute the function in this case or 
     does it merely compute the address and disposes of it?
 12. Check With for evaluation (has any of the expressions specified on 
     WITH changed value on use and it should of course not have in the 
     C code to make it equivalent to the MODUAL version)?
 13. make non-exported funtions static 13. FIXME/XXX/--rtc/machine 
     dependencies
 14. at_init
